## HTML ```<div>``` Tag

### Example

A ```<div>``` section in a document that is styled with CSS:
```html
<html>
<head>
<style>
.myDiv {
  border: 5px outset red;
  background-color: lightblue;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="myDiv">
  <h2>This is a heading in a div element</h2>
  <p>This is some text in a div element.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```
The ```<div>``` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The ```<div>``` tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

The ```<div>``` tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

Any sort of content can be put inside the ```<div>``` tag! 

Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the ```<div>``` element.

## HTML ```<span>``` Tag

### Example

A ```<span>``` element which is used to color a part of a text:
```html
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>
```

## Definition and Usage

The ```<span>``` tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The ```<span>``` tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

The ```<span>``` tag is much like the ```<div>``` element, but ```<div>``` is a block-level element and ```<span>``` is an inline element.
